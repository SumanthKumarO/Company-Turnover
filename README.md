# Company-Turnover
Thus project is all about analyzing the turnover of the company . It is developed by using Python and Machine Algorithms.It comes under Supervised Machine Learning . The algorithm we used is Linear Regression.
Initally we have analyzed each and every independent variable and how it is affecting the turnover of the company. You find the EDA in the file "Project.ipynb"
And later we have used Multi Linear Regression and analyzed hoe two among the all threee independent variables are affecting the Company Turnover and calclated the accuracy and metrics like RMSE and R-Square.You can find it in the file named "Company Turnover.ipynb"
Finally we have taken all the three independent variables as input and predicted the Profit gained by the company. And calulated the accuracy and the metrics. You can find this file in "All Features.ipynb"
